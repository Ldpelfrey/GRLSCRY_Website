      "DJ and producer building trance house that doesn't ask for permission—it just takes the room. Dark, high-energy, made for 3 a.m. when the filters are off and people actually move.",
      "No chasing trends, no forced hype. Just clean, heavy sound that hits your chest and stays there. Raw emotion wrapped in tight rhythm. Tracks that don't fade, sets that don't apologize, a brand that shows up the same way every time: intentional, untouchable, a little dangerous.",

    "inspiration": "GRLSCRY pulls from the real late-night underbelly: blacked-out warehouses, bass that hits your chest, feral crowds moving like tomorrow's cancelled. Sweat, smoke, glances that stick under dim strobes. Built by people who already own the room. Beats land with quiet empathy, natural charisma, subtle edge. Slowed techno that shifts your head, indie dance built for 2026."
